Proof of concept for websockets, rn they just send plain text but I trust you can use your imagination to see how it could be JSONS

If you want to play with it open index.html in a browser and run `npm install ws` then `node server.js` then start playing
There really isnt much to play with but hey it works and that has to count for something right
